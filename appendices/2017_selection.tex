%%Early stopping is employed to avoid model over-training using the following
%%heuristic. The training is performed separately per working point where, at
%%each training iteration (epoch), the computation of a ROC with 1,000 linearly
%%spaced points between the network targets in the validation set is used to
%%extract the MLP parameters in three specific epochs (referred as multi-stop
%%algorithm):
%%
%%\begin{itemize}
%%\item \spmax Network: retrieves first epoch resulting in highest \spmax.
%%\item \pd Network: retrieves parameters in the first epoch resulting in
%%  lowest background efficiency when operating near the
%%  targeted working point ($|\Delta(\pd)|=\epsilon<0.2\%$);
%%\item \pf Network: parameters are obtained from the first epoch resulting in
%%  highest signal efficiency when operating near the targeted background
%%  ($|\Delta(\pf)|=\epsilon<0.2\%$) ;
%%\end{itemize}
%%
%%The training is finished when it fails to improve the aforementioned criteria
%%for 50 consecutive epochs, but, also, to reduce MSE for 25 consecutive epochs,
%%in order to avoid premature stops without considering the measure employed in
%%parameter optimization. Efficiency improvements where observed during Run~1 when
%%employing the \spmax instead of the MSE for the epoch in which the parameters
%%are extracted, as the first is more suitable estimative of the model performance
%%for the classification task. Similarly, the \pd and \pf networks were evaluated
%%during 2017 to seek for models with superior operation around the working point,
%%as opposed to the \spmax which would optimize the models for a balanced
%%efficiency between the classes. From the 100 optimizations, one network per
%%criteria is chosen to avoid local optima. At this point, the cross-validation
%%efficiencies are computed and graphical evaluation through box plots is assessed
%%to manually choose the model number of hidden nodes (hyper-parameter). To choose
%%the operating model, efficiency over the full dataset is computed and the best
%%performing models are selected. Finally, we retrieve the cross-validation and
%%full dataset efficiencies for the three (\pd, \pf, \spmax) networks per phase
%%space regions and choose the appropriated benchmark taking into account a
%%subjective analysis of the working point emphasis and the resulting
%%efficiencies.
