\AtlasAbstract{%
The ATLAS experiment implements an ensemble of neural networks (NeuralRinger
algorithm) dedicated to early removal of fake electrons in its first, fast,
\textcolor{red}{High Level Trigger selection stage}. In the second half of 2017, the
NeuralRinger was set to operate for the selection of electrons above 15 GeV, as part of an effort to reduce CPU usage to comply with more
stringent data taking conditions. Inspired by the ensemble of likelihood models
currently operating in the \textcolor{red}{electron offline selection algorithms}, the NeuralRinger ensemble
\textcolor{red}{is built from} Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models tuned on pseudo-rapidity and
transverse energy bins, in order to minimize trigger performance impacts from both
detector response and shower development \textcolor{red}{energy dependences}. The MLPs are fed from calorimetry information
formatted into energy sums of concentric rings built around the particle
axis and normalized by its total transverse energy. This note describes the
algorithm, its operation efficiency and the results from the analyses done for its characterization. Using this algorithm results in a 60 \% decrease in CPU demands for the lowest-threshold unprescaled
single-electron trigger, while maintaining electron efficiency nearly unchanged.
The analysis results show an overall CPU saving of 8 \%, when considering the
demands of all electron and photon triggers. \textcolor{red}{This increase of performance  results from a higher jet background rejection with respect to previous algorithms}.
